Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

The idea to solve this problem is to iterate the val from start to end using a for loop and for every number,
 if it is greater than 1, check if it divides n. If we find any other number which divides, print that value.
